what is Go- interfaces, why do we use, what is the importent of interfaces
Introudction_Interfaces:
    An interface in Go is a collection of method signatures.

    “Interfaces in Go define behavior. They allow different types to implement the same behavior implicitly, enabling polymorphism, loose coupling, and easier testing.”
    Interface = WHAT can be done
    Struct = HOW it is done
    Interview-friendly >>
    “Interfaces in Go allow different types to behave the same way, so code depends on behavior instead of concrete types.”
    “Passing interfaces instead of structs makes functions reusable, extensible, and loosely coupled.”

    Use structs to represent things,
    use interfaces to represent roles.
